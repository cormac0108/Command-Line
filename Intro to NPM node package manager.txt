
Node Package Manager Intro (NPM)
for devs to share JS code that they have written,  npm website. You can search for packages. 
Stored in the npm registry which keeps track of files that have been submitted. packages (or modules)
the packages contain two things:  a package.json file (a meta file which describes the package)
and a js file.  use others code.... to add functionality... Use collective knowledge. 
downsides:  not all packages have good code.  It also adds more byte size to your project. Each file
will be sent from the web server to the browser (web dev) as youknow this can effect web page 
load speed.   yarn is a tool to grab things from the npm registry. its very similar to npm. 

3 types of packages:  1. frontend 2. command line - more commands  3. one for node.js on the backend
3 things in any project:  1. HTML + CSS + Javascript  2. Github Repo + Git 
3. Package.json file
